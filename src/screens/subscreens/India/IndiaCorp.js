In other words, India has to, as a matter of domestic legal procedure and past precedents, issue a separate notification so that benefits extended to a third country can be imported and made part of a tax treaty with the country with which it has an MFN clause.",

In other words, what is relevant for the application of the beneficial provision of the MFN clause is the date, when the tax treaty from which the beneficial provisions are being imported, was entered into and whether the country with which such treaty was entered into was a member of the OECD on the date when such country entered into with the tax treaty with India and not whether such country was a member of the OECD on the date when the benefit is being claimed by the non-resident in question.",

Even otherwise, the benefit of the lower rate would not have been available in the absence of a specific notification by the Indian government specifically extending the beneficial rate agreed with such country to other countries."
